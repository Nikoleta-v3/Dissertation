\chapter{Literature Review}

Following the initial work done by Axelrod, there are many other papers that
have tried to tackle the PD and make their conclusions on cooperation in
both theoretical and real life behavior. In this chapter we review some of this
work done in the IPD competitions, in spatial and evolutionary game theory.

\section{Tournaments}

In order to get a understanding of how to play the game of the Prisoner's Dilemma
better, Robert Axelrod held a tournament back in 1980. He invited a number of
well-known game theorists to submit strategies for a computer tournament.
Each strategy has to specify whether to cooperate or defect based on the
history \footnote{The previous moves made by a player.} of both players.
Strategies played again each other as well as a Random strategy, that would
randomly choose between C and D and with its own twin. The tournament was of
round robin and all entries new the exact length (200 moves) of each game.
Fourteen strategies were submitted and by the end Tit for Tat was announced the
winner. Surprisingly in the second tournament held where 64 strategies
competed and all they writes had full knowledge of what have happened in the
first tournament, Tit for Tat managed to get first place again.\parencite{Axelrod1980a}

Tit for Tat is a deterministic strategy that will always cooperate in the first
round and afterwards it copies the opponents last move. Surprisingly in the
second tournament held by Axelrod \parencite{Axelrod1980a} where 64 strategies
competed and all they writes had full knowledge of what have happened in the
first tournament, Tit for Tat managed to get first place again.
As explained by Axelrod \parencite{Axelrod1980b}, Tit for Tat, a simple strategy was able to
win the rest of sophisticated and more complex strategies based on three specific
characteristics of the strategy:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Niceness:  A strategy is categorized as nice if it was not the
                    first to defect, or at least, it will not do this until
                    the last few moves.
  \item Forgiveness: The propensity to cooperate in the moves after the
                     opponent defected.
  \item Clarity: After opponents identified that they were playing Tit for Tat
                 choose to cooperate for the rest of the game.
\end{itemize}

The first tournaments were an innovation in combining computer modeling and Game
Theory and in providing insights in the behavior emerging from simple dynamics.
Moreover, Axelrod was the first to speak about niceness, forgiveness and gave an
illustration that cooperation can be a victorious and advantageous strategy.

There have been other tournaments, based off of Axelrodâ€™s, exploring different
environments and submitting new strategies. In 1991 Bendor, Kramer and Stout
introduced noise to the IPD. Where noisy randomly flip the choice made by a strategy.
Kerts 2011 conducted a tournament where the payoff matrix was altered though
satisfying the conditions (1.1), (1.2) . In 1992, Nowak and May reproduced the first
tournament with a spatial topology. Furthermore, some review tournaments are
listed below :

\section{Spatial Structure Tournaments}

A research was spawn in 1992 as to how the Prisoner's Dilemma could shade some
insight into physics and biology. Where they believed exist potential dynamics
of spatially extended systems. Their tournament was a simple and purely
deterministic spatial version of the PD in a two dimensional lattice. With
players having no memory of the previous rounds and no strategical elaboration.
Thus, the players could either always cooperate or defect. The local winner of
each generation would win a territory. His neighbors would follow his strategy.
This  allowed them generate spatial chaotic patterns, which patterns depended
on the payoff of Temptation. Nowak and May concluded that co-operational
behavior is possible in the PD by using a spatial topology.

Similarly, in \parencite{Lindgren1994} players were allowed to have
memory and therefore added complex strategies to the tournament such as Tit for
Tat and  Anti Tit for Tat. This was followed  by the work of
\parencite{Brauchli1999} which introduced even more
complex strategies.

Spatial topology has been defined most scholars have as a square lattice where
the nodes - players only interact with their neighborhoods.Including connections
between four or eight nearest neighbor sites, Neuman's or Moore's, according to
Figure~\ref{fig:neighborhood}. A square lattice  is a graph and one could argue
that a round robin tournament itself is a complete graph. But in the above papers
none author a spatial structure as graph, expect from \parencite{Meng2015} where
they defined it as a network.

Meng et all, was an interesting approach. They presented a new spatial prisoner's
dilemma game model in which the neighborhood size was increased onto two
two interdependent lattices. They implement the utility by integrating the payoff
correlations between two lattices. A player would mimic a random player in his next
move, base on a function that consider the utility of the player. It was characterized
as a most realistic scenario.

Real life interactions are more likely to be like any given graph depending on
the industry than a complete graph. Fatha et all, have considered a numerous of graphs,
such as :
\begin{itemize}
  \item Lattice, the interaction network is defined by the sites of a lattice.
   the distance between a pair does not exceed a given value.
   The most frequently used structure is the square lattice with von Neumann
   neighborhood and Moore neighborhood.
  \item Small word, a graph that is created from a square lattice by randomly
   rewiring a fraction of connections in a way that conserve the degree for
   each site.
  \item Scale-free graphs, a network that has a power-law degree distribution, regardless of
   any other structure.
  \item Evolving networks, networks that change as a function of time.
\end{itemize}

The major theme of their review was how the graph structure of interactions could
modify long term behavioral patterns emerging in evolutionary games.
These graphs compose only a small fraction of graphs that exist. In this
dissertation we will consider a list of graphs.

\section{Axelrod Python Library}

The Axelrod library (.ref) is an open source Python package that allows for
reproducible game theoretic research into the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma[url].
For many of the tournaments aforementioned the original source code is almost never
available and in no cases is the available code well-documented, easily modified
or released with significant test suites. Due to that reproducing the results
has not been an easy task.

However, Axelrod library manages to provide such a resource, with facilities for
the design of new strategies and interactions between them, as well as
conducting tournaments and ecological simulations for populations of strategies.

Strategies are implemented as classes which have a single method, strategy().
It only takes one argument, which is the opponent's previous moves and returns
an action. These actions can be either to cooperate C or to defect D. At thins
moment the Axelrod library consists of 131 strategies.Can be found in the Appendix.

Additionally, tournament are classes responsible for running a repetition of a
round robins. It achieves that by calling a match generator class which
returns all the single match parameters, such as turns, the game and the noise.
Axelrod has the capability to write out the results into a csv file and also out
put plots with the ranks of the strategies.

Furthermore, a basic tournament of 200 turns, 100 repetitions and the 131 strategies
that exist in the library is being produced continuously. The winner is called
PSO gambler and it is a look up strategy. It uses a lookup table with probability
numbers generated using a Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm.
Here are illustrated the results of the last tournament :

Because is an open source library it makes it easy for us to contribute to it
make modifications needed for this dissertation.
