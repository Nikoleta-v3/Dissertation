\chapter{Implementation of spatial tournaments}
\label{chap:Three}

\section{Introduction}
In this chapter we will discuss the source code committed to the
Axelrod-Python library to implement spatial topology. In addition, some
initial experiments and results will be discussed. These experiments will be
performed using three chosen topologies and two different competitiros size.

\subsection{Code Discussion}

As analyzed in \autoref{chap:Two}, the Axelrod library uses a
\texttt{Tournament()} class to run a round robin tournament. The
\texttt{RoundRobinTournament()} itself calls upon
another class the \texttt{Match Generator()} which is responsible to generate
the matches. In a round robin cause(\texttt{RoundRobinMatches()}), it generates
matches for each player
against the rest. The parameters and the index of the pair are push to it
by the \texttt{build single match()}. A generator that lives within the class.
For a round robin tournament the structure of the code is illustrated in~\ref{fig:rbr}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}[sibling distance=10em,
      every node/.style = {shape=rectangle, rounded corners,
        draw, align=center,
        top color=white, bottom color=blue!20}]]
      \node {Tournament()}
        child { node {RoundRobinTournament}
          child { node {RoundRobinMatches()}
            child { node {build single match()} } }
           };
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Code structure for a Round Robin tournament.}
  \label{fig:rbr}
\end{figure}

In order for us to implement a Spatial topology tournament we need to follow a
similar approach. Firstly a new \texttt{Match Generator()} class was written.
The \texttt{SpatialMatches()} is a class that generates spatially-structured
matches. In these matches, players interact only with their neighbors rather
than the entire population. According to \cite{Archdeacon1996} graphs can be
represents in many different ways, one of which is by lists of edges.
Due to a various number of python packages that are used for graph manipulation,
we want to generalize the representation of the edges.
For the \texttt{SpatialMatches()} do understand
which players are connected to each other, the edges are passed as a list
argument. The \texttt{SpatialMatches()} will only create matches between the
ending nodes of these edges. Finally the class \texttt{SpatialTournament()}
runs the spatial tournament. The code structure now that the spatial tournaments
have been added can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:cds}

\begin{figure}
\centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}[sibling distance=15em,
      every node/.style = {shape=rectangle, rounded corners,
        draw, align=center,
        top color=white, bottom color=blue!20}]]
      \node {Tournament()}
        child { node {RoundRobinTournament()}
          child { node {RoundRobinMatches()}
            child { node {build single match()} } }}
        child { node {SpatialTournament()}
          child { node {SpatialMatches()}
            child { node {build single match()} } }
           };
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Code structure for when Round Robin and Spatial tournaments are
           implemented.}
  \label{fig:cds}
\end{figure}

In Axelrod library all the components are automatically tested using a
combination of unit, property and integration tests(using \url{travis-ci.org}).
Once a new feature is added to the library, corresponding test must also be written.
The test are used to ensure compatibility and ensure that we get the expected
results. The tests for the \texttt{SpatialTournament()} can be found here :
\url{https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod/blob/master/axelrod/tests/unit/test_tournament.py}
under the class \texttt{TestSpatialTournament()}.


\subsection{Experiment and the three topologies}

In this chapter we will be running some simple examples of spatial topology and
analyze the behavior of the strategies and the results. This will help us further
down to tackle the problem of how topology can affect the outcome of an IPD
competition and which strategies tend to perform well. Some of the most common
networks, based o literature, are a square lattice with four degrees
and a cycle.

In a cycle or circular network consist of a single cycle. It has
equal number of edges and nodes, and each node has degree 2. In ~\cite{Szabo2007}
Szabo et all stated that "For spatial models the fixed interaction network is
defined by the sites of a lattice and the edges between those pair whose distance
does not exceed a given value."  The most frequently used structure, and the one
used in this experiment, is the square lattice with von Neumann neighborhood.
Also the most common topology used, again based on literature, is that of a
round robin. A round round topology is nothing else but a complete
graph were every pair of distinct node is connected by a unique edge.
Figure~\ref{fig:networks}, shows an example of all the aforementioned topologies.
Round robin will be mainly used for comparison reasons.

\label{fig:networks}
\end{figure}

Thus, we will be performing our experiment with three different topologies, that
of a cycle, a lattice and a complete graph.
For each topology, a fixed size of strategies out of the 132 of Axelrod-Python
library are chosen randomly. These strategies create a neighborhood.
The size of these neighborhoods will range. Let \( s\) be the size of
the neighborhood, where \(s \textrm{ }\{ s=5 \textrm{and} s=50 \}\).
Subsequently, the strategies are allocated on the graph, based
on the topology, and they compete with their neighbors on a IPD tournament.
For the circular and lattice topology, once the first game is complete,
the strategies are randomly shuffled and allocated on the graph again.
Another tournament is performed this time with different neighbors of a
neighborhood interacting. This is repeated 10 times.
The selection of strategies and creation of neighborhoods is repeated 100 times
and each tournament of an IPD consists of 200 turns and 10 repetitions.

By setting an axelrod-seed~\footnote{A function used by the library, which sets
both seeds for Numpy and the standard library.In general, seeds allow us
reproduce the same players and tournaments.}, the 100 neighborhoods for the
topologies are the same, of course their allocation to the graphs differs because
of the random shuffle.

\subsection{Initial Analysis}

For each of the experiment we have forced to keep in track for a set of parameters,
such as the list of players in a neighborhood, the score, normalized score and
average score for each strategy etc. From a quick look at these data sets
we can obtain the following informations.

For the spatial tournaments, for both neighborhood sizes (5 and 50)
we achieved 1000 tournaments. Containing 100 different neighborhoods, where each
the exists for 10 tournaments.

Moreover, for the cycle experiment we can see in Table [], that degree is
fixed at 2 and the payoffs are fixed to \(R=3, P=1, S=0, T=5\) for both
\( s=5\textrm{ and } s=50 \). For \(s=5\), the mean average score
is 2.45, with a minimum value of 0.0175 and a maximum value of 4.95. The
mean average score of the neighbors score is 980.95 with a standard deviation
of 219.87. Moreover the minimum value is set at 141.55 and the maximum at
1756.50. The mean average score does not seem to differ for \(s=5\),
which is at 2.39. Though, in the experiment with a size of fifty a strategy
achieved a score of 0. Additionally the average score of the neighbors ranges
from 19.30 to 1884.5. In both cases of size the clustering coefficient is zero
and the connectivity due to fixed degree is 2.

For the lattice experiment a table that summarize the data set is shown in Table
~\ref{sum-lattice}. For both size's values the payoffs are the same (\(R=3, P=1, S=0, T=5\))
and the degree is fixed at 4. For \(s=50\) the mean average score
varies between 0.018 and 4.97. The average score of the neighbors varies from
832.67 and 2895.42. Much higher than both the cycle experiments achieve. Logical
based on the fact that the number of neighbors is now doubled. For \(s=5\)
the mean score is 0.57 and the mean average neighbor score 2.45.
The clustering coefficient is 1 and for \(s=50\) is 0.5.
This shows that in the lattice example the strategies tend to create groups.

Finally, for the round robin tournaments 100 tournaments were performed for both
neighborhood sizes. Parameters such as neighborhood size and neighbor's score
were not computed for the round robin topology. Because all players
interact with each other we would not get any additional information. In
Table~\ref{sum-rr}, we can see the average score the strategies achieved
in this topology for both sizes. In a neighborhood of a size 50, the mean average
score is 2.39 with an standard deviation of 0.335. For \(s=5\) we can notice that the values
are almost equal to those of the lattice topology with \(s=5\).

\newpage
In this section we gone through the structure of the source code for implementing
the Spatial Tournament, by adding to the Axelrod-Python library. Furthermore, now
that the code is usable various experiments were conducted with different topologies
and number of players participating in each tournament. An overview of the results
was done but now in the following sections we will go though some more intense
analysis.

\section{Analyzing the effect of the topologies}
\label{sub:effects}

For all experiments all 132 strategies of Axelrod-Python library have participated
at least in a one tournament. Here we will go through the strategies and their
performance in each experiment. Not all strategies participated in an equal number
of tournaments. Forcing the strategies to perform in a uniform number is not an
option as we want to keep the random effect for validation of the results.
On could argue that by participating in a larger number of tournaments, the
probability of winning increases as well. Thus, instead of number of winning
tournaments our analysis will be using the ratio of wins. By wining ratio we mean
the number of tournaments a strategy first place divided by the number of tournaments
the strategy competed in. Additionally, the normalized average score each strategy
achieved will also be studied. Mainly to study the variation, helping us to make
conclusions on how the neighborhood could affect the strategy.
Lastly, having all different factors such as degree, neighbors, clustering, scores
etc building a regression model could point out effects on the results.

\subsection{Winning Ratio}
\label{sub:winning-ratio}

The winning rations for all three topologies for a neighborhood size equal to
5 are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:winning-five}. In the experiment where the
strategies compete on a cycle topology 124 strategies out of the 132 have a
winning ration greater than zero. The strategies which did not are ALLCorALLD,
Tricky Cooperator, ThueMorseInverse, Hard Tit For 2 Tats,	SolutionB5, Cycler DDC,
Prober and BackStabber.
In the lattice topology as well, 8 strategies do not have a non- zero winning ratio.
Fortress4, Bully, Tricky Cooperator, Hard Go By Majority: 40, 5 and 10.
Also Cycler DDC and ALLCorALLD have a similar performance in this topology as well.
In the round robin tournament various strategies
ranked last, among them Fortress4 and the whole family of Hard Go By Majority.

On the other hand the strategies with the highest winning ration for each
topology are as follow :
\begin{itemize}
  \item Cycle topology with a winning ratio of 0.56 ZD-GEN-2, followed by Punisher
        with 0.55
  \item Lattice topology with a ratio of 0.45 BackStabber and Meta Majority
        Memory one
  \item Round Robin topology with a winning ratio of 1 : Raider, Gradual, Limited
        Retaliate(0.05/20) and BackStabber
\end{itemize}

\label{fig:winning-five}
\end{figure}

\newpage

Same approach for a neighborhood size of 50. In these experiments
non strategies have a zero ratio. Figure~\ref{fig:winning-fifty}, illustrates the ratios
for each topology in ascending order. The strategies with the highest winning ratio
for each respective topologies are as follow :

\begin{itemize}
  \item Cycle topology with a winning ratio of 1.3 Raider
  \item Lattice topology with a winning ratio of 1.3 Raider
  \item Round Robin topology with a winning ration of 0.833 EvolvedLookerUp
\end{itemize}

Unexpectedly, strategy Raider seems to have dominated the first place in both
the cycle and the lattice topology. It achieved a winning ration of 1.3, 0.5
more than the strategy ranked second. Another surprise in the results is
that of the round robin topology. Where almost all strategies have a winning ratio
of zero. Only 14 strategy managed a ratio higher than hero. The strategy with
the highest on of all was EvolvedLookerUp.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \begin{subfigure}[t]{1\textwidth}

    \caption{Winning ration round robin s=50.}
    \end{subfigure}
\caption{Winning ratio for all three topologies s=50.}
\label{fig:winning-fifty}
\end{figure}

The strategies with the highest ratios seem to vary depending on the topology
and the size. Though for \(s=5\) it did not seemed to be an similarity between
the highest rank strategies for \(s=50\) is dominated by the strategy Raider.
To further investigate this behavior, the winning ratio was plotted against
the numbers of participations the strategy had. Figure~\ref{fig:winning-ratio-five}
illustrates the plots for \(s=5\) and Figure~\ref{fig:winning-ratio-fifty} for \(s=50\).

For \(s=5\) we observe that for the topologies lattice and round robin there is
no correlation between the participations and the winning ratio. Thus, the
number of tournaments that a strategy has competed in does not affect its
the winning percentage. In a cycle topology, there tends to be a positive
correlation. Thus, we can
guess that the strategies that were ranked first in these topology had high
participating rates as well. Cycle seems to have different results and that could
be because of the degree number.On the contrary, for \(s=5\) topologies cycle and
lattice show that the
number of participations have a negative effect on your winning ratio. Thus, playing
less in these experiments could help you achieve a better outcome. This results
were unexpected as well. For the round robin topology, that so little strategies
achieved a winning ratio of non zero, participating seems to now have any effect.

In conclusion, the only strategy that performed well in more than one experiment
was the strategy Raider. Raider's winning ratio varies from 1 to 1.3 depending
on the topology. The only experiment it did not perform as well as the others
was in that of cycle topology size 5, which is the only topology that has a
positive correlation between winning ratio and participations. And Raider
only competed 10 times which could be the reason behind it's lack of performance.

\subsection{Average Scores}

The normalized average score is calculated by diving the average score
of each strategy with their participating rates. Then the average score
is plotted against the strategies. As shown in both Figure~\ref{fig:average-score-five}
and Figure~\ref{fig:average-score-fifty},
there is variation everywhere. Thus, all strategy had different levels of
average score for each experiment. Meaning the performance in your experiments
was not based so much on the strategy itself. Other reasons could be, participating
rates, neighborhood or it could even be completely randomized. Furthermore,
the average score is plotted against participations to identify any hidden effects.

Finally, a common methodology when investing factors as predictors is building a
regression model. We are building
a model wanting to identify any factor that can explain the average score of a
strategy. The model is the following :

\begin{equation}\label{regmodel}
\begin{split}
normalized\textrm{ }average\textrm{ }score = degree + average\textrm{ }neighborhood\textrm{ }score + \\
clustering + number\textrm{ }of\textrm{ }participations
\end{split}
\end{equation}

The round robin topology is not included in this subsection analysis. As explained
above, parameters as average neighborhood score was not monitored. We believe
that in a round robin topology factors like do not have significant effects.
Also round robin topology was mainly used for comparison reasons.
The model was used to each of the experiments for lattice and cycle topologies.
The results of models are shown below, Table~\ref{regression} :

In the output we can see that Degree, average neighborhood score and participations
are significant predictors for all the experiments with a \(p\) value less than an 0.00.
Lower than the common alpha level of 0.05
For the cycle topology, average neighborhood score and participations have a negative
coefficients. For example a decrease in participations by one would increase
the average score by 0.0016. Degree on the other hand has a positive coefficient
and connectivity has no effect at all. Furthermore the model for \(s=5\) has
a R-square value of 0.457, thus it only explains 0.4 variation of the data which is
quite insignificant. For \(s=50\) it is even lower at only 0.12.

Finally, for the lattice topology only participations have a negative coefficients.
Thus the only factor with a reverse influence on average score in the lattice topology.
Connectivity is an significant predictor as well with a coefficient 0.0064 and
0.0003 respectively. Though the R-square value is still significant small,
with a value 0.547 and 0.216 respectively.
Even if there are predictors with a significant \(p\) value, the overall
performance of the model does not give us enough evidence. Thus no validate
conclusion can be made for the model.

\section{Summary}

In this section we will make a summary of all the previous analysis that was made
in~\ref{sub:effects}. Furthermore, compare the results produced by all
six experiments. The strategies which managed to get a high winning ratio and
identify any further relationship between the performance of a strategy and the
topology.

From the analysis that was performed in~\ref{sub:winning-ratio}, the wining ratio
for each strategy for all 6 experiments indicated the following :
\begin{itemize}
  \item For the cycle topology of \(s=5\) ZD-GEN-2 had the highest winning ratio
        and for the lattice BackStabber and Meta Majority Memory one
  \item For round robin s=50, most of the strategies finished the experiment
        with winning ratio of zero.
  \item Raider seem to have successful performance in both lattice and cycle \(s=50\)
        and in round robin \(s=5\).
        robin
\end{itemize}

An attempt to find any significant reason as to why these strategies outperform
the rest returned the findings below :
\begin{itemize}
  \item Participating rate has a negative effect on the winning ratio for \(s=50\)
        in lattice and cycle topology and a positive in cycle for \(s=5\)
  \item There is high variation is the average score of each strategy for all
        experiments
  \item Regression model for the normalized average score did not return any
        significant results.
\end{itemize}

In conclusion, the network topologies used in these examples seem to have be
simple and no real results were able to emerge. There were quite a few surprises.
Raider outperforming so many other strategies, the negative effect of participation
and winning ration. Moving forwards new experiments a list of recommended
additions would be :
\begin{itemize}
  \item More complicated and random topologies
  \item Different neighborhood sizes. Probably randomize the size as well
  \item To be able to compare the strategies that ranked high we will keep track
        of their cooperation rate. Thus we will be able to classify them
        on how cooperative they are.
\end{itemize}
