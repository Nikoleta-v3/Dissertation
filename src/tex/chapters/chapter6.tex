\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{chap:Six}

In this chapter the conclusions of the experiments held in
~\autoref{chap:Three} and in ~\autoref{chap:Four}, as well as the results
of the genetic algorithm for training the new strategy, in ~\autoref{chap:Five}
are presented. Furthermore, the potential areas of development are
ideas are discussed.

\section{Conclusions}
\subsection{Affects of Topology}

In ~\autoref{chap:Three} and in ~\autoref{chap:Four}, the effects of the spatial
topology on the strategies of the Axelrod-Python library has been studied. These
was done producing data by various types of spatial tournaments.

In ~\autoref{chap:Three}, once the source code needed to run such tournament
has been implemented, an initial experiment was conducted using simple network
topologies. The resutls of the analysis showed that some of the high ranks strategies
of the IPD, such as Raider and PSO Gambler made their appearance. Still their
ranks differ based on the topology. The measure that was used was the winning
ratio and the normalized score. The research as to why return that it could
not be predicted. Even if topology did affect the strategies and the winners,
how and was not necesseraly clean.

In ~\autoref{chap:Three}, an new attempt to indentify the reasons behind performance
was once again undergone. The median normalized rank was indentified to be a much better
measure, but even so the results of the experiment have been once again random.
PSO Gambler did achieve a high place on again. But the regression showed that
only a few strategies could be predicted. And the rest seems to be affected
by different predictors. This could be an effect of the game play of each strategy
of even by the enviroment itself.

Thus further reserach is needed for validate resutls
\subsection{New LookerUp Strategy}

In an attempt to indentify a winning streatygy in the spaital random experiment
that have been conducted. The work of M Jones and his LookerUp strategy were mimiced.
A new strategy using an objective function based on the median normalized score
has been perforfm. Due to time costrainf the generations had to be stopped
quick. Thus this were the resutls

\section{Limitations and Further Research}
\subsection{Limitations}

In thisdissertation most of the code for the spatial topology, large parts of the gentic algorithm
have to be implemented. Thus the time for runing the experiment has been descreaded.
Most of the tournaments themself needed a lot time. Thus the the biggest constraing
of this dissertation has been time.

With futher time, the experiments in both chaoter could have been used for
more number of player , tournaments sizes, repitions and networks. This would
made possible for more data to be conducted and have more to run our analysis
wiht a hope of better results.

Data are evrything in the analysis. For exaple in hapter 3 only two specific
tournament sizes have been used. ANd in chapter4 now all method reach maximum capacity.

Futhermore more, for yhe genetic algorithm, time had been even less. The genetic
alorgitm and the spaital tournaments made it impossible to run big ames, with
manu players. more turns and repitions and more generations. Thus a better solutions
as in the futher reaserach could possible be achieved

- Time constrains.
- Generate more data
- Run more generations for genetic algorithm
\subsubsection{Further Research}

for further research, i would like to run more comple networks. even from the complex
networks ionyl three types have been shoosen were thousand of graphs exists.

THe regression models did not managed to explain any of the results. This could have been
because of the lack of data. Even s, more regresiion could be perform such as
forward elimination regression and logistic regression.

- More complex networks
- Regressions, forward regression and logistic regression
- Make LookerUp compete in experiments
