\chapter{Complex Networks Experiments}
\label{chap:Four}

\section{Introduction}
In this chapter experiments with more complex networks will be performed.
Explaining these networks and the reasons behind their selection will be covered
in the beginning. Moreover, the experiment structure itself will be discussed.
Finally going through an analysis on the results. Using again the winning
ratio to rank the strategies and the normalized average score. Also performing
a classification on the strategies and building a regression model.

In comparison to the work done in ~\ref{chap:Three}, in this chapter few things will
be altered. A complete network spatial tournament will act instead of a round
robin one. As be explained in a previous chapter they are one and the same. But



Instead of a round robin tournament a complete network spatial
tournament will be implemenet.

\subsection{Networks}

Helping us produce better full data sets and giving to possibility of a
more intense research. Actions such as. ROund robin tournament should be
behaved as a spatial complete tournament for comparison reason. Classifing the
strategies to give us ny hind of the game play. An analysis on regression
for an overall data set will all topologies. One could argue that all above experiments
were conducted in simple topologies and small number of repititions. Thus the first thing we will
do is fix this .

  \item Small world
  \item Binomial
  \item Complete Graph
