                                        	its choice is determined from the 3 preceding outcomes in the following manner.
                                        	Let A be the sum formed by counting the other's defection as 2 points and one's
                                        	own as 1 point, and giving weights of 16, 4, and 1 to the preceding three
                                        	moves in chronological order. The choice can be described as defecting only
                                        	when A equals 1, 6, 7, 17, 22, 23, 26, 29, 30, 31, 33, 38, 39, 45, 49, 54,
                                        	55, 58, or 61. Thus if all three preceding moves are mutual defection,
                                        	A = 63 and the rule cooperates. This rule was designed for use in laboratory
                                        	experiments as a stooge which had a memory and appeared to be trustworthy,
                                        	potentially cooperative, but not gullible.
