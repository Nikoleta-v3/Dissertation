\chapter{Acknowledgements}
There have been various people that work in Cardiff University that I would
like to thank for their support during this intense year.


I would like to thank all the lecturers of Cardiff University that taught on
the MSc taught program, for enlightening me and my collegues through their teaching.
Also for their continuous support and guidance through the year.
I would like to extend a special thank you to Mrs Joanna Emery for making this
entire year possible for me. Finally, I would like to express my sincere gratitude
to my academic supervisor Dr Vince Knight, for his support, advice and constant
ideas. To whom I lied once during this dissertation; yes the tables were being
overwritten.
